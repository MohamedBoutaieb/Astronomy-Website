              <h3>POWERFUL MAGNETIC FIELDS</h3>
              <p>The most powerful magnetic fields in the universe are from magnets - neutron stars with crazy
                  magnetic fields. How crazy is that? On Earth, your typical magnet has a strength of about 1.25
                  Tesla. A magnetar will have 1,010 Tesla. This is so strong that the magnetic field would literally
                  kill you if you get within 1,000 kilometers of the magnetar by distorting the electrons in your
                  body
                  too much. All the electrons in the atoms in your body would be stripped away, so all the molecules
                  would break apart. So you'd be ionized into a whiff of plasma, basically.</p>

              <h3>THE SUNâ€™S MASS TAKES UP 99.86% OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM</h3>
              <p>The Sun accounts for 99.86% of the mass in our solar system with a mass of around 330,000 times
                  that
                  of Earth. Did you know that the Sun is made up of mostly hydrogen (three quarters worth) with the
                  rest of its mass attributed to helium. If the Sun had a voice would it be high and squeaky from
                  all
                  that helium?</p>
