                <h3>POWERFUL MAGNETIC FIELDS</h3>
                <p>The most powerful magnetic fields in the universe are from magnets - neutron stars with crazy
                    magnetic fields. How crazy is that? On Earth, your typical magnet has a strength of about 1.25
                    Tesla. A magnetar will have 1,010 Tesla. This is so strong that the magnetic field would literally
                    kill you if you get within 1,000 kilometers of the magnetar by distorting the electrons in your body
                    too much. All the electrons in the atoms in your body would be stripped away, so all the molecules
                    would break apart. So you'd be ionized into a whiff of plasma, basically.</p>

                <h3>THE SUNâ€™S MASS TAKES UP 99.86% OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM</h3>
                <p>The Sun accounts for 99.86% of the mass in our solar system with a mass of around 330,000 times that
                    of Earth. Did you know that the Sun is made up of mostly hydrogen (three quarters worth) with the
                    rest of its mass attributed to helium. If the Sun had a voice would it be high and squeaky from all
                    that helium?</p>
